Start: If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be 
better off reading some other story. In this story, not only is there no 
happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle.

It all started with a baby bird, her name was Jane. From a young age, Jane was always overlooked.
When her mom would come to deliver food her siblings always got more, leaving Jane hungry for most
of her childhood. In addition she never got any attention from her siblings or mom. Then, one day
Jane's mom decided it was time for the baby birds to learn to fly.

Jane was once again rejected by her mother who did not care if she knew how to fly or not and decided to just not teach her so Jane had to learn on her own. She took really small steps but eventually she learned how to fly all on her own and was able to get more food than everyone else.
